      <h1>How to add directories to your PATH</h1>

      <p>
        This is my first post in this blog, and I thought I should make
        something useful out of it, and teach you guys how to add directories
        to your PATH variable in a Linux/Unix system. So without further ado,
        let's get to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this small tutorial, I'm assuming you're already acquainted with
        the terminal and you know the most basic commands, such as
        <code>ls</code>, <code>cd</code>, etc. And you've already written your
        own shell scripts, though that could also be talked about in another
        post.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered why some commands require you to <code>cd</code>
        into the same directory of the executable, and type
        <code>./command</code>, while others just need the name of the command,
        and can be executed from anywhere? That's because those commands are
        executable files in one of the directories in your <code>PATH</code>.
        "And what is this PATH?" you might ask. It is a list of directories
        with all the directories that contain the commands you can execute from
        your terminal. To be more precise, it is an environment variable with a
        single string that shows you the full path to each of the directories
        your system will search for the commands you execute, separated by
        colons. To see the value of your PATH, you can use the command
        <code>echo ${PATH}</code>. Your tipical PATH will look something like
        the one below.
      </p>
      <pre>
$ echo "${PATH}"
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin</pre>
      <p>
        These are the most basic directories to guarantee your system works as
        it should. With the exception of /usr/local/bin, if you erase any of
        them from your PATH, then you're in for a bad surprise. Though, there
        are also ways to circumvent that.
