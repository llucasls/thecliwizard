      <h1>How to add directories to your PATH</h1>

      <p>
        This is my first post in this blog, and I thought I should make
        something useful out of it, and teach you guys how to add directories
        to your PATH variable in a Linux/Unix system. So without further ado,
        let's get to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this small tutorial, I'm assuming you're already acquainted with
        the terminal and you know the most basic commands, such as
        <code>ls</code>, <code>cd</code>, etc. And you've already written your
        own shell scripts, though that could also be talked about in another
        post.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you ever wondered why some commands require you to <code>cd</code>
        into the same directory of the executable, and type
        <code>./command</code>, while others just need the name of the command,
        and can be executed from anywhere? That's because those commands are
        executable files in one of the directories in your <code>PATH</code>.
        "And what is this PATH?" you might ask. It is a list of directories
        with all the directories that contain the commands you can execute from
        your terminal. To be more precise, it is an environment variable with a
        single string that shows you the full path to each of the directories
        your system will search for the commands you execute, separated by
        colons. To see the value of your PATH, you can use the command
        <code>echo ${PATH}</code>. Your tipical <code>PATH</code> will look
        something like the one below.
      </p>
      <pre>
$ echo "${PATH}"
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin</pre>
      <p>
        These are the most basic directories to guarantee your system works as
        it should. With the exception of /usr/local/bin, if you erase any of
        them from your <code>PATH</code>, then you're in for a bad surprise.
        Though, there are also ways to circumvent that. We'll get to that in a
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now, you can see the directories available in your
        <code>PATH</code>. But how can you add more to the list? Let's say you
        want to add <code>~/.local/bin</code> to the list, which is in fact a
        pretty common directory for your own scripts. To add it, you can do it
        in two simple steps:
      </p>
      <pre>
$ PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"
$ export PATH</pre>
      <p>
        The first command creates a shell variable with the same name as the
        environment variable we want to replace, and it references the
        variables <code>HOME</code> and <code>PATH</code> in its value. The
        second command exports it so it can be read by all child processes,
        effectively making it an environment variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice the symbols, such
        as braces, quotation marks, equal sign and dollar sign. The dollar sign
        makes a reference to a shell variable or an environment variable,
        allowing you to read its value. The braces are optional, but they
        ensure you take the whole word as the name of the variable. You can use
        <code>$HOME</code> to read the value of <code>HOME</code>, for example.
        But if you have variables called <code>H</code>, <code>HO</code> or
        <code>HOM</code>, they'll get in the way. So the braces prevent that.
        The quotation marks are also optional, but they ensure the value read
        is a single string. Not really needed in this case, but it's nice to
        get used to them when setting variables. And notice the name of the
        variable and the value after the assignement are "glued" to the equal
        sign. It is actually supposed to be like that, and putting spaces
        either before or after it will mess it up. Oh, and using <code>~</code>
        will not work as your home directory. You have to use the
        <code>HOME</code> environment variable, which expands into the full
        path of your home directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this new <code>PATH</code> is only valid for the current
        instance of the terminal. If you close it and open another one, the
        variable will be reset to its previous value. That happens because
        environment variables can only pass from parent to child processes, not
        the other way around. So how can you make it valid for all terminals
        you might open up? You can do it in your <code>.profile</code>, in most
        cases. If your login shell is bash, and you have a
        <code>.bash_profile</code> or <code>.bash_login</code>, those will take
        priority over <code>.profile</code>. If you use zsh, then you have
        <code>.zprofile</code>. If you use <code>startx</code> to log in, then
        you have to edit <code>.xinitrc</code>. And if you use <code>xdm</code>
        as your display manager, then you have to edit
        <code>.Xresources</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now, what happens if you erase the <code>PATH</code> variable? Or
        you forget the dollar sign in <code>${PATH}</code>, which is basically
        the same thing? Next time you try to log in, if you type your password
        wrong, you will get an error message and not be able to log in,
        obviously. But if you type it right, it will simply error silently, and
        you'll also not be able to log in. So what you should do is press
        <code>Ctrl + Alt + F2</code> to go into tty2, or any other up until
        tty6. The tty1 is where your graphical session is, for most display
        managers. Once you reach the tty, type in your username and password.
        You should be able to log in, and be greeted with an entirely black
        terminal covering your whole screen. No GUI here. Also, no commands.
        You have to write the whole path for each command, but if you log into
        root with sudo, the <code>PATH</code> should be fine. So, putting the
        commands you need:
      </p>
      <pre>
$ /bin/sudo -i
# cd /home/wizard  # use your own username
# vim .profile</pre>
      <p>
        The first command requires the full path, since you borked the
        <code>PATH</code> environment variable. The <code>-i</code> flag
        means <code>--login</code>, which will let you use the
        <code>root</code> user account, with all its privileges. Then you
        change directory into your own user's <code>HOME</code>. If you use
        <code>cd</code>, <code>cd ~</code> or <code>cd $HOME</code>, you will
        be taken to <code>/root</code>, the root user's home directory. You
        DO NOT want to mess with this directory, so make sure you change into
        the right one. You can check your current directory with
        <code>pwd</code>. Now, open the <code>.profile</code> file with your
        favorite text editor. GUI editors won't work here, so you can't use
        gedit, kate or vscode. If you don't know how to use vim or nano, then
        you can rename <code>.profile</code> with either one of those
        commands below:
      </p>
      <pre>
# mv .profile another_file     # mv can be used to either move or rename
# rename pro amateur .profile  # relax, we've all been there</pre>
      <p>
        After that, you can type <code>exit</code> twice to log out, and go
        back to tty1 with <code>Ctrl + Alt + F1</code>. If you used
        <code>vim</code> or <code>nano</code>, or <code>nvim</code>, or
        <code>emacsclient --tty</code> (who knows), then your <code>PATH</code>
        variable is edited correctly. If you renamed it, then you can rename it
        back to <code>.profile</code> (or whatever your usual login script name
        is) and make sure you write it correctly this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        There you go. Your new directory is added to your <code>PATH</code>.
        Put whatever scripts or binaries into this new directory, and hack
        away!
